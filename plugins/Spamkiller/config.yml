#CHECKS
#Weight affects by how much the mute time will be multiplied for each check, minimum weight is 1
#E.g. if a player receives a 2 second mute from a check with a weight of 20, the mute will instead be set to 2*20 = 40 seconds
#Note that weight does not translate to mute time 1:1 for each check, some checks are just made in a way that makes them more harsh by default, even at low weight

#If you want to disable a check, set enabled to false for that check, don't set the weight to 0

#Player mute time is a sum of mute times of all the checks for a message that the player has sent
#E.g. If player receives a 20 second mute for repeated char and a 30 second mute for caps lock, their mute will be equal to 50 seconds

#Maximum-mute-time defines how much a check can contrubute to total mute time in seconds
#E.g. if set to 120, player cannot be muted for more than 120 seconds by that check

#Block-instead determines whether that check will block the message instead of affecting the mute time
#If set to true, that check will not contribute to the mute time at all
#It will only block the message, and send the player the message set in block-message below

#Will be displayed for a player when, instead of being muted, their message gets blocked

#Some nicknames may be considered spam by the plugin (E.g. nicknames with lots of repeating characters)

#This is intended to check for messages longer than a certain amount of characters, for short messages "short similarity" is used instead
